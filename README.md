MATLAB

This is a repository including a set of MATLAB functions for carrying out a variety of tasks:

1) Cogent

  - There are several functions to simplify stimulus presentation if using the Cogent toolbox.
  
2) Data_Config

  - There are some generic functions that will allow you to configure your data in different ways. 
  
3) EEG

  - If you are using the EEGLab toolbox to analyse your EEG data, there are lots of functions for plotting data. There are also a variety     of functions if you intend on using the STUDY protocol.
  
4) Plotting_And_Statistics

  - If you prefer to do statistics in MATLAB, there are lots of functions for doing statistical analysis (ANOVA, permutation-based analysos, regression, post-hoc tests, etc.)
  
There are also some other functions that carry out tasks that don't fit into the above categories. There is a function documentation to give information on what inputs the functions require, any optional inputs, and what the function outputs.

Note that optional argument inputs into functions follow the following format:

exampleFunction(MandatoryArgument1,MandatoryArgument2, ... 
                'OptionalArgument1',OptionalArgument1_Value, ...
                'OptionalArgument2',OptionalArgument2_Value);
                
CorelScript

Also inclues some very basic functions for batch processing of images in CorelPhoto, for example, cropping images, squaring them, resizing to fixed width/height (cm / pixels).

In the future, I will include any functions that are written in:

  - VisualBasic
  - Python
  - C/C++
